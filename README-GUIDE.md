## Who this is for

Any code project that needs to:

* Explain what it is, who it is for, and why it matters.
* Onboard users fast with a minimal Quickstart.
* Persuade with clear differentiation and proof.
* Invite adoption, collaboration, and contributions.

Works for open source, internal tools, research code, libraries, CLIs, services, and apps.

---

## Core principles

1. **Clarity first** - plain English, minimal assumptions, short sentences.
2. **Skimmable** - headings, bullets, and examples over prose.
3. **Fast start** - a working Quickstart within 60 seconds.
4. **Split depth** - README for overview, `docs/` for detail.
5. **Slight sell** - why this over alternatives, shown not hyped.
6. **AI-ready** - structured sections, explicit labels, stable links.
7. **Truthful and current** - keep it accurate or mark status clearly.

---

## Canonical README structure

Use the sections below in this order. Omit what you do not need, but keep the top five.

### 1) Title and one-line tagline

* Project name as `# Heading`.
* One sentence that states category and outcome.
* Optional 3 bullets for highlights or constraints.

```
# Chronos
Time-series toolkit for anomaly detection and forecasting.
- Production-grade pipelines
- Pluggable models
- Works with Postgres and S3
```

### 2) TL;DR

* Who it is for, the problem, the outcome. One short paragraph.

### 3) Differentiation

* 3 to 5 bullets on what makes it different or better.
* Optional brief comparison table linking to alternatives docs.

### 4) Quickstart

* Fastest path to a running example. Prefer one command.
* Include minimal prerequisites and the smallest working sample.

```bash
# Install
pip install chronos-ts

# Run a demo
chronos demo ./data/retail.csv
```

If multiple install methods exist, show the simplest here and link others:

* Docker
* From source
* Package managers

### 5) Basic usage example

* One minimal example with expected output.
* Link to more examples or tutorials.

```bash
chronos detect --input data.csv --column revenue
# -> prints timestamped anomalies and scores
```

### 6) Features

* Bullet list of core capabilities, not implementation details.
* If useful, group by user goal.

### 7) Requirements and compatibility

* Supported OS, runtime versions, CPU/GPU needs.
* Breaking version notes if relevant.

### 8) Configuration

* Table or bullets of key options and defaults.
* Link to full config reference.

### 9) Architecture snapshot (optional)

* One diagram or paragraph describing components and flow.
* Link to `docs/architecture.md` for detail.

### 10) Roadmap or project status

* Current status: experimental, beta, stable, maintenance, archived.
* Short roadmap bullets or link to milestones.

### 11) Support

* Primary support channel: issues, discussions, email, chat.
* Response expectations if you want to set them.

### 12) Contributing

* Invite contributions.
* Link to `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

### 13) Security

* How to report vulnerabilities.
* Link to `docs/SECURITY.md`.

### 14) License

* Short line with license name and link to `LICENSE`.

### 15) Acknowledgements and credits

* People, projects, or sponsors to credit.

## Linking out to deeper docs

Keep the README lean. Put depth in `docs/` and reference it clearly.

Recommended layout:

```
.
├─ README.md
├─ LICENSE
├─ docs/
│  ├─ CONTRIBUTING.md
│  ├─ SECURITY.md
│  ├─ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
│  ├─ QUICKSTART.md
│  ├─ INSTALL.md
│  ├─ USAGE.md
│  ├─ CONFIGURATION.md
│  ├─ ARCHITECTURE.md
│  └─ ROADMAP.md
└─ .github/
   ├─ ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
   └─ PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
```

Link with stable relative URLs so they work on and off GitHub:

* See [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md)
* Security policy: [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)

---

## AI-readability checklist

Help agents extract context without guessing.

* Clear section headings that match common labels: Title, TL;DR, Quickstart, Usage, Features, Requirements, License, Security, Contributing.
* Stable relative links to deeper docs, not just wiki URLs.
* A short, explicit **context block** near the top:

```yaml
# context.yaml (inline in README or separate file)
project: Chronos
domain: time-series analysis
audience: data engineers, ML engineers
runtime: Python 3.10+
interfaces: CLI, Python API
storage: local FS, S3
status: beta
license: MIT
support: GitHub Issues
```

* Tables for options and outputs with clear headers.
* One minimal working command that does not require secrets.
* Versioned claims: “Requires Python 3.10+” not “latest Python”.
* Explicit status: active, maintenance, or archived.

---

## Light marketing without the cringe

You are positioning, not pitching.

* **Positioning statement**: “For \[audience] who need \[outcome], \[project] is a \[category] that \[value]. Unlike \[alternatives], it \[differentiator].”
* **Social proof**: small badge row for stars, releases, CI passing, coverage, package downloads.
* **Evidence**: short benchmarks, a 20–60 second GIF, a link to a case study or blog post.
* **Honest constraints**: what it does not do yet. Builds trust.
